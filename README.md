# BAMFINTECH

We work with with two files 1) index.html and 2) app.py

App.py is the chatbot which loads the HTMLS as source to provide reponses on a users question.

Index.html is a personal bank dashboard.

To run app.py, you need an OpenAI API key (make sure to insert it in the env. file)

Then:
1) install: pip install -r requirements.txt
2) streamlit run app.py
3) upload the html in the app, so that it can access the source.
4) interact with the finchat ai and have it make links between the numbers!
